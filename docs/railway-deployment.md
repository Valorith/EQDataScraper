# Railway Deployment Compatibility

## Overview

The smart port management system is fully compatible with Railway deployment and will not interfere with Railway's port allocation or environment configuration.

## How It Works in Deployment

### 1. **Environment Detection**
The system automatically detects Railway deployment environment by checking for:
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`
- `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` 
- `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`
- `PORT` environment variable (Railway standard)

### 2. **Deployment Mode Behavior**
When deployment environment is detected:

```bash
üöÄ Deployment environment detected - using environment variables
üì¶ Deployment environment - skipping file sync
üì¶ Deployment environment - keyboard handlers disabled
```

### 3. **Port Handling in Railway**
- **Backend**: Uses `PORT` or `BACKEND_PORT` environment variables
- **Frontend**: Uses Railway's provided `PORT` 
- **No Local Conflicts**: Skips local port conflict detection
- **No File Modification**: Doesn't sync localhost URLs

## Railway Environment Variables

### Required (Railway sets these automatically):
- `PORT` - Railway assigns this for your service
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` - Railway deployment indicator

### Optional (you can set these in Railway):
- `BACKEND_PORT` - Override backend port if needed
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL` - Backend URL for frontend (usually Railway service URL)

## Deployment Safety Features

### 1. **No File System Modifications**
In deployment environments, the system:
- ‚úÖ Uses environment variables only
- ‚ùå Does NOT modify source files
- ‚ùå Does NOT create config.json
- ‚ùå Does NOT sync localhost URLs

### 2. **No Interactive Features**
In deployment:
- ‚ùå Keyboard handlers disabled (Ctrl+R)
- ‚ùå No terminal manipulation
- ‚úÖ Environment-based configuration only

### 3. **Fallback Configuration**
If environment variables are missing:
- Backend defaults to Railway's `PORT`
- Frontend uses existing configuration
- No conflicts with Railway's port assignment

## Testing Railway Compatibility

### 1. **Simulate Railway Environment**
```bash
export RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
export PORT=8080
python3 run.py start
```

Expected output:
```
üöÄ Deployment environment detected - using environment variables
üì¶ Deployment environment - skipping file sync
üì¶ Deployment environment - keyboard handlers disabled
‚úÖ Backend server started on port 8080
```

### 2. **Verify No File Changes**
In deployment mode, no local files should be modified:
- `src/stores/spells.js` unchanged
- `src/App.vue` unchanged  
- `vite.config.js` unchanged
- No `.env.development` created

## Railway Deployment Checklist

- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly respected
- ‚úÖ No local file modifications in production
- ‚úÖ PORT environment variable used correctly
- ‚úÖ Frontend builds with correct backend URL
- ‚úÖ No terminal/keyboard interference
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback if port management is bypassed

## Frontend Configuration for Railway

The frontend already handles Railway deployment correctly:

```javascript
// In stores/spells.js and App.vue
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL || 
  (import.meta.env.PROD ? 'https://eqdatascraper-backend-production.up.railway.app' : 'http://localhost:5016')
```

Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in Railway to your backend service URL.

## Benefits for Railway Deployment

1. **Zero Interference**: Smart port management doesn't interfere with Railway
2. **Environment Aware**: Automatically detects and respects Railway environment
3. **Development/Production Separation**: Full features locally, deployment-safe in production
4. **No Configuration Needed**: Works out of the box with Railway's defaults
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Existing Railway deployments continue to work unchanged
